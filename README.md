Magento Cause Campaign Extension
================================

Magento extension to allow merchants to run campaigns to raise funds for specific causes.

This is just meant to be an experiment to help learn Magento extension development better, but perhaps it could
turn into something that someone might actually want to use.

The goal is to allow the merchant to run a campaign that would pledge X% of the revenue per order to a specific charity,
and provide some marketing materials to the consumer that lets them know what the merchant is doing, how much has
already been collected and how much a particular order is going to contribute.
